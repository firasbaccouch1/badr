    Hair follicles Choice of donor area.<br> The area must be adequate and rich in healthy hair follicles.<br> The specialist applies local anesthesia in the donor area to harvest the hair follicles one by one with special tools for hair transplantation.<br> The collected hair follicles are kept in a special liquid at a constant temperature.<br> The hair follicles are carefully placed in the recipient area so that
    hair looks 100% natural, growing at the right angle and in the right direction.<br> In beard and mustache transplantation, the extraordinary results of FUE technology.<br> FUE beard and mustache transplantation leaves no scars or deformations on the patient’s face and there is no pain after the operation.<br> The difference is visible immediately after hair transplantation, providing natural shape and density.<br>
    Before the beard transplant
    Beard transplantation begins between the ages of 20 and 22 when hormones are stable.<br> Sideburn transplant and eyebrow transplant have a similarity with this transplant, it is a method used by people with uneven and missing hair.<br> Beard transplantation is not like hair transplantation; because people have beards of different densities.<br> In case of loss, in this case, planning the density of the beard in the area creates harmony with the
    surrounding hairs.<br> If the patient is beardless according to the desired density, the hair follicle transplant is between 1500-3000.<br>
    After the beard transplant
    Due to clotted blood, the beard transplant area looks like the red area.<br> When cleaning after 24 or 48 hours, the clotted blood is cleaned and the beards become visible.<br> The body nourishes the follicles of the transplanted beard, bleeding occurs in the transplanted area.<br> This bleeding will disappear in 1 to 2 weeks.<br> This method similar to Hair Transplant is currently priced differently from Hair Transplant.<br> The reason for this is that
    Beard follicles are made with a narrower working range than hair follicles.<br>
    What is Mustache Transplant?
    Transplantation of hair follicles in the upper lip area of people who have no or no dense hair on the upper lip is called mustache transplant therapy.<br> This act is performed using the FUE method.<br> In this method, local anesthesia is used and a 2-3 hour microsurgery is performed.<br> With FUE, hair follicles can be transplanted into the dermis indefinitely.<br> The person requesting the transplant
    makes the decision on the number of hair follicles and the donor area.<br> Hair follicles are placed in this area of the person using tools that can transplant up to 0.<br>7 mm.<br> After the first graft, approximately after 4 months, a new graft is possible in case of sparse areas.<br> As this graft is relatively difficult and requires skill, the graft must be performed by
    expert specialists in this field.<br> Otherwise, the transplant will give negative results.<br>

    The process before the mustache transplant?
    If you decide to have your mustache transplanted during the appointment with your specialist, a beard plan will be drawn up.<br> During this planning, it is decided how many follicles will be transplanted, in which area the transplantation will be performed and which technique will be used.<br> In order for the transplanted follicles to be nourished in a healthy and easy way, do not transplant more than necessary.<br> Therefore, take into account the recommendations of your medical specialist.<br> The other thing to consider is the hair transplant technique.<br> For some years, the method without risk of leaving marks and with very little damage is the FUE method and this technique is widely used.<br>

    On the day of surgery, choose loose clothing that is easy to put on and take off and that will not rub your face.<br> Cigarettes complicate the operation and recovery, which is why you should not smoke before the mustache transplant.<br> Excessive demands and expectations should be avoided.<br> You should eat light meals and if you are not hungry you should go to the hospital.<br> If you regularly take medication before the operation, it is imperative to inform the doctor.<br> Do not take any medication without the advice of our doctor.<br> Alcohol should not be consumed.<br> If you have a mustache, don’t cut it.<br> On the day of the intervention, after the analyzes if it is necessary to shorten it, this is carried out in a hospital environment.<br> Stay away from caffeinated beverages.<br>

    how is the intervention carried out?
    Rest assured, the eyebrow transplant is not a major operation.<br> This procedure only takes one day.<br> The transplant can last from 1h30 to 3h on average.<br> However, a complete eyebrow reconstruction can take up to 5 hours.<br> The operation is performed under local anesthesia.<br> You can then go home and even return to work the next day.<br>

    Before the intervention
    Consultation with an expert required.<br> The point is to make a diagnosis and see what can be done (particularly depending on eyebrow thickness and size) – and whether or not this procedure is really right for you.<br>


    The day of the procedure
    A beautician comes to draw the shape of your eyebrows according to your wishes and according to the plan established with the doctor.<br> The transplant can then begin.<br> To do this, a shaving line is drawn under the hair at the back of the head, the specialist tells us.<br> Why in this place? Because it is imperceptible and hair growth is continuous.<br>

    When can the results be observed after a transplant?
    The results are visible from the first weeks after the eyebrow transplant.<br> You should know that your implanted hair will fall out within the first three months! Don’t worry, this is perfectly normal.<br> This allows new hair to start growing.<br> “You will see day by day that the line of your eyebrows will take shape and that the sparse areas will fade”, adds the expert.<br> The care of your eyebrows can begin.<br>

    2- Hair transplant with the FUE method<br>

    We are proud of the experience of hair transplantation without scars and without side effects.<br> This FUE hair transplant technique is a common method; Specialists begin by removing hair follicles from the nape of the neck (hairline donor area) without leaving any abnormal appearance in the donor area.<br> During a hair transplant, approximately 4,000 to 4,500 hair follicles are implanted using a new FUE technique that gives a natural look and stops causes of hair loss.<br> What is the FUE technique? For 30 years, a step towards professionalism has been taken every day in the field of hair transplantation.<br> The FUE hair transplantation technique is the technique that has enabled the rapid popularity of hair transplantation in the world.<br> FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) entered the literature in 2002, it offered a very important advantage in by offering the possibility of a hair transplant without incisions, without stitches and without traces.<br> Therefore, traceless and natural hair transplantation has become a globally chosen solution for hair loss.<br>

    A-Collection of hair follicles with the FUE method<br>

    The FUE hair transplant (Follicular Unit Extraction) is a method used since 2002 and whose principle is to extract one by one the hair follicles of the neck without making a linear incision.<br> When the graft harvesting operation is performed, small incisions are made around the follicular unit using circular microchips, the hair follicles are harvested one by one in the Invovo style and transplanted into the balding area.<br>

    B-Canal incision with the FUE Method<br>

    After the graft harvesting is completed, the hair follicle harvesting area is bandaged to avoid any problems.<br> After this operation, the patient lies on his back.<br> During the incision of the FUE hair transplant channel, the recipient area is numbed with local anesthesia.<br> Then the canal incision operation is performed.<br> The incision is made using an advanced tool called a micropen.<br> These channels are opened depending on the size of the hair follicle.<br> The removed hair follicles are placed in these channels.<br> The direction of the channels, the depth and the width must be in harmony with the hair follicles.<br>

    C-Placement of hair follicles with FUE Hair Transplantation<br>

    The last step of Fue Hair Transplant is the placement of hair follicles in the incisions.<br> Immediately after the removal process, the hair follicles placed in special boxes are regularly removed individually and inserted into the open incisions.<br>

    3- Postoperative measures of a hair implant transplant<br>

    This hair surgery is minimally invasive and the patient can resume their daily activities very quickly.<br> However, it would be advisable to take some precautions to avoid the risk of postoperative complications of hair transplantation.<br>

    After leaving the clinic, the surgeon prescribes painkillers to relieve the feeling of tension in the top and back of the head.<br> To avoid infection and inflammation, the patient is instructed to take antibiotics and anti-inflammatories for the week following the transplant.<br>

    Finally, it is recommended to wash the hair with a mild shampoo two days after the transplant and to avoid violent massages.<br> When can you see the final result of a hair transplant? Grafts begin to regrow on average 70 days after transplantation.<br> And if you take into account that the speed of hair growth is one centimeter per month, then after 10 months (on average) the grafts will have an optimal size.<br>
    ',
    'hair_transplant_for_men_desc2' => '4- What are the different methods that exist for CAPILARY transplantation?<br>

    A-FUT hair transplant<br>

    The FUT method of hair transplantation (Follicular Unit Transplantation) or technique known as “striping” consists of cutting a strip of scalp in an area of permanent hair on the patient.<br> Then this strip is divided into several follicular units which are reimplanted in the bald part of the patient’s head in holes previously dug by incisions to receive these grafts.<br>

    B-FUE hair transplant<br>

    Another extraction method is the FUE follicular unit extraction technique.<br> Instead of harvesting an entire strip of scalp, this time hair follicles are harvested one by one from the patient’s donor hair.<br> On the other hand, the implantation of these follicular units is identical, making incisions in the recipient part to implant the grafts like the FUTs.<br>

    C-IFA hair transplant<br>

    The IFA method of automated follicle implantation differs from FUT and FUE in that the hair follicles are removed mechanically.<br> The mechanical gesture of extracting the follicular units from the patient’s skull is performed by a Safer, Neograft or Artas robot.<br> The grafts are then implanted invasively in incisions identical to FUT and FUE in the hairless area.<br>

    D-DHI hair transplant<br>

    The DHI method of hair implants is an advanced and non-invasive form of FUE, i.<br> H the extraction of hair follicles one by one.<br> However, the DHI technique differs from all the others in that the entire hair transplant process is carried out manually by an experienced doctor, from the extraction of each follicle to the implantation of each of these grafts.<br>

    This method is performed manually with a high-precision DHI capillary injector and allows the doctor to control step by step the depth, angle and direction of implantation of each hair follicle.<br> Therefore, this hair transplant technique is performed without incisions on the donor and recipient side, leaving no scars and producing a completely natural and dense result.<br>

    'hair_transplantation_for_women_desc1' => 'To counter the phenomenon of female androgenetic alopecia, hair transplantation is a procedure that is increasingly practiced.<br> With this technique you can find thick and natural hair thanks to a non-invasive and painless method.<br> However, it is important to ask the right questions before undertaking such surgery.<br>
    In hair transplantation for women, the reasons for hair loss are different from those for men.<br> It can be an inadequate diet, certain diseases such as alopecia or certain hormonal disorders.<br> Therefore, in order to ensure the treatment of the causes of hair loss before hair transplantation, it is very important to carry out a general medical examination.<br>
    <br>

    Hair transplant in women
    <br>
    Hair loss is often associated with men and affects a large number of women as well.<br> However, thinning does not occur in the same way and develops in 3 different stages according to the Ludwig Scale.<br> Thus, women can also perform a hair transplant using the FUE method and the same techniques as the procedure on a man.<br>
    <br>
    In women, hair loss can occur from their twenties, but 40% of them experience hair loss during hormonal changes.<br> This way, the hair at the top of the head is thinned and weakened, exposing the scalp.<br>
    <br>
    Hair transplant without shaving for women
    <br>
    In DHI hair transplantation procedures, it is possible to perform hair transplantation in a more suitable way.<br> This makes it easier to achieve a more natural look.<br> Since the waiting time of hair follicles before and after hair transplantation is minimized, the loss of hair follicles is reduced.<br> With the hair transplant pen, it is possible to specify the angle and direction, and the angles of the implanted hair follicles can be determined much more easily.<br> DHI hair transplantation offers the possibility of grafting directly into the needed area without damaging the existing hair while providing an added benefit to people who have not completely lost their hair.<br> During transplantation, holes the size of the hair follicles are open, in this way the operation is completed with the least damage.<br>
    <br>
    How is the operation
    <br>
    Step 1: Hair assessment and evaluation of the donor area
    <br>
    Step 2: Drawing the hairline and extraction area
    <br>
    Step 3: Anesthesia

    Step 4: Extraction of follicular units

    Step 5: Classification of grafts

    Step 6: Planting the bulbs
    <br>
    Step 7: Postoperative control and follow-up of regrowth stages
    <br>
    From what age can a woman proceed to a hair transplant?
    <br>
    If your general state of health allows it, there is no minimum age required for hair transplantation in women.<br> However, it is advisable to decide on a minoxidil treatment before considering its use.<br> In general, this solution is not recommended for women under 23, but it is not impossible.<br>
    ',
    'hair_transplantation_for_women_desc2' => 'In which cases is a female hair transplant not possible

    As with men, this type of operation is almost always possible for women.<br> However, there are a few exceptions to the rule, such as when the bald patch is too large, the donor area is not dense enough, or the patient is not healthy.<br>
    <br>
    Is a hair operation more complicated for women than for men?
    <br>
    Like men, women are increasingly using hair implants.<br> To date, more than 15% of the female population have used this procedure to resolve their baldness.<br> Therefore, it is clear that a hair transplant, whether for a woman or a man, is always the same procedure.<br> So, with a woman, it’s not more complicated.<br>

    <br>
    Procedure Overview:
    <br>
    Preoperative Evaluation: Before undergoing gastric bypass surgery, patients undergo a thorough evaluation to assess their overall health and suitability for the procedure.<br> This evaluation includes a review of medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.<br>
    <br>
    Surgery: Gastric bypass surgery is performed under general anesthesia.<br> The surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach using staples or a gastric band, which limits the amount of food the stomach can hold.<br> Then, a section of the small intestine is connected to the pouch, bypassing the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine.<br> This rerouting of the digestive system reduces the absorption of calories and nutrients, leading to weight loss.<br>
    <br>
    Hospital Stay: Following surgery, patients typically stay in the hospital for several days to monitor their recovery and manage any postoperative complications.<br>

    Reduced Hunger: The smaller stomach pouch and rerouted digestive system reduce the production of hunger-stimulating hormones, helping patients feel full and satisfied with smaller portions of food.<br>

    'liposuction_title'=> 'Liposuction at Tiraz Clinic',
    'liposuction_desc1' => 'At Tiraz Clinic, we offer liposuction procedures to help patients achieve a slimmer and more contoured body shape.<br> Liposuction, also known as lipo, is a surgical technique that removes excess fat deposits from specific areas of the body to improve proportions and enhance overall appearance.<br>
    <br>
    Procedure Overview:
    <br>
    Initial Consultation: During your initial consultation, our experienced plastic surgeons will assess your individual needs and goals.<br> We\'ll discuss the areas of your body you\'d like to target with liposuction and determine the best approach to achieve optimal results.<br>
    <br>
    Preparation: Before the procedure, you\'ll receive personalized instructions on how to prepare, including any necessary lab tests and medications to avoid.<br>
    <br>
    Anesthesia: Liposuction can be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, depending on the extent of the procedure and your surgeon\'s recommendation.<br>
    <br>
    Fat Removal: Using a thin tube called a cannula, your surgeon will carefully remove excess fat from the targeted areas through small incisions.<br> The cannula is inserted beneath the skin and moved back and forth to loosen fat deposits, which are then suctioned out of the body.<br>
    <br>
    Closing Incisions: Once the fat removal is complete, incisions are closed with sutures, and dressings or compression garments may be applied to support the healing process.<br>
    <br>
    Recovery: After liposuction, you\'ll be provided with post-operative care instructions, including information on pain management, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments.<br> It\'s essential to follow these instructions closely to ensure a smooth recovery and optimal results.<br>
